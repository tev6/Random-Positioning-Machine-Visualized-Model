Random-Positioning Machine Microgravity Visualize Simulator (RPMSim-random)
An advanced interactive 3D simulator of Random Positioning Machines (RPM) with randomized rotation dynamics, designed to visualize and study microgravity simulation via gravity-vector averaging. This model extends the base RPM simulation by introducing stochastic rotational parameters, aligning with real-world RPM research requirements for minimizing biological adaptation to periodic motion.

# üìñ Overview

This project provides a high-fidelity, academic-grade 3D simulation of Random Positioning Machines (RPM)‚Äîa critical ground-based tool for microgravity research. Unlike fixed-ratio RPM simulators, RPMSim-random incorporates randomized rotation speeds, dynamic speed transitions, and adjustable speed ratio modes to replicate the quasi-random motion essential for suppressing biological graviresponse.
The simulator visualizes how RPMs achieve functional weightlessness by continuously reorienting a sample along two orthogonal axes (outer frame: X-axis; inner frame: Y-axis). By randomizing rotational parameters, it mimics the "quasi-ergodic" gravity vector coverage required for accurate biological and materials science experiments.

# üîë Key Features

Feature	Description
Adaptive Random Rotation	Supports three rotation ratio modes: fixed (e.g., golden ratio œÜ‚âà1.618), random (1.4‚Äì1.6 range), and alternating irrational ratios (‚àö2, œÜ, 1.5, ‚àö3).
Smooth Speed Transitions	Gradual 2-second transitions between target speeds to avoid mechanical shock, with a maximum angular acceleration of 0.01 rad/s¬≤.
Real-Time Gravity Visualization	Green downward gravity vector (‚ÄìY direction) with an arrow indicator, plus an orange trajectory line tracking gravity exposure history.
Biological Sample Representation	Semi-transparent 6-colored cube (0.4f size) simulating biological samples, with face-specific colors for orientation tracking.
Dynamic Motor Feedback	Motor indicators change color with speed: blue (low) ‚Üí green (medium) ‚Üí red (high), providing intuitive speed monitoring.
Interactive Camera Control	Mouse drag to rotate the camera; preset initial angle (X:25¬∞, Y:-35¬∞) for optimal viewing.
Comprehensive Status Display	On-screen metrics: rotation angles, current speeds, ratio mode, transition state, and control instructions.

# üß™ Scientific Background

RPMs simulate microgravity by gravity-vector averaging‚Äîa process where continuous reorientation of the sample makes the gravity vector change faster than the biological system‚Äôs response time. This results in a net experienced gravity approaching zero.
Critical Principles Implemented:
Quasi-Random Motion: Randomized speed ratios prevent periodic gravity vector patterns, avoiding biological adaptation (a key limitation of fixed-ratio clinostats).
Angular Velocity Range: Rotation speeds (0.3‚Äì0.7 rad/s) are calibrated to ensure gravity vector changes outpace typical biological response times (10s‚Äìhours for cells/plants).
Irrational Ratios: Alternating mode uses irrational numbers (e.g., golden ratio œÜ) to ensure non-repeating rotation patterns, maximizing gravity vector dispersion on the unit sphere.
